# How to setup Whanos

## Prerequisites

- Configured Google Cloud Account
- Terraform

## Set up GCP

After creating your GCP account, create or modify the following resources to enable Terraform to provision your infrastructure:

- A GCP Project: GCP organizes resources into projects. [Create one now](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate) in the GCP console and make note of the project ID. You can see a list of your projects in the [cloud resource manager](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager).

- Google Compute Engine: Enable Google Compute Engine for your project [in the GCP console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/compute.googleapis.com). Make sure to select the project you are using to follow this tutorial and click the "Enable" button.

- Google Kubernetes Engine: Enable Kubernetes Engine for your project [in the GCP console](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/container.googleapis.com). Make sure to select the project you are using to follow this tutorial and click the "Enable" button.

- A GCP service account key: [Create a service account key](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey) to enable Terraform to access your GCP account. When creating the key, use the following settings:

  - Select the project you created in the previous step.
  - Click "Create Service Account".
  - Give it any name you like and click "Create".
  - For the Role, choose "Project -> Editor", then click "Continue".
  - Skip granting additional users access, and click "Done".

    After you create your service account, download your service account key.

  - Select your service account from the list.
  - Select the "Keys" tab.
  - In the drop down menu, select "Create new key".
  - Leave the "Key Type" as JSON.
  - Click "Create" to create the key and save the key file to your system.

    You can read more about service account keys in [Google's documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys).
